===================
3.0 GETTING STARTED
===================

3.1 GOAL

The goal of NingPo MahJong is to remove all the tiles from the board by finding 
matching pairs of 'free tiles'. A tile is considered free when there is no tile 
on top of it and if either the left or right edge is unobstructed.

Two tiles match if they are of the same suit and value. The honor tiles do not 
have a value, but can be matched with any other tile of the same type.

The game is over when all tiles are removed or there are no more matching free 
tiles.

NOTE: A free tile is outlined by a green box when the cursor is over it. 
A blocked tile is oultined by a red box.

3.2 CUSTOMIZING YOUR GAME

After the game loads, you will see a screen that allows you to pick your layout, 
tile set and background. You can browse through the available selections by 
clicking on the yellow arrow buttons. Click 'START' to begin the game.

NOTE: Many tile sets and layouts are are only available in the registered version 
of NingPo MahJong.
